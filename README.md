# sd2018

This was material for the
[SD2018](https://www.eso.org/sci/meetings/2018/SingleDish2018.html)
workshop, where all the final presentation (some draft versions are
available here as well) are available. Some other material (scripts and
tutorials) are left here "as is" but likely available in improved
versions in their own original locations (e.g. CLASS and CASA/QAC).
