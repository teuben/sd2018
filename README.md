# sd2018

material for the
[SD2018](https://www.eso.org/sci/meetings/2018/SingleDish2018.html)
workshop, please note that until published, nothing is final here, as
the tutorials and talks are still under discussion. Officially
registration was closed on Feb 1, 2018.

The idea is that the computing information here will supersede what
you might read on the ESO website, particularly during the workshop
days.


## Software needed

   * CASA: https://casa.nrao.edu/casa_obtaining.shtml. The current release is 5.1.2 but we 5.1.1 is ok as well.
      * QAC, TP2VIS, SD2VIS are components we will likely need to have installed as well.
   * GILDAS CLASS: https://www.iram.fr/IRAMFR/GILDAS/gildasli2.html
   * BoA: http://www3.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/div/submmtech/software/boa/boa_main.html
   * IDL (requires license) + scanamorphos:  http://www2.iap.fr/users/roussel/artemis/
   (a link to dedicated scripts for ArTeMiS will be added later)

and recommended

   * vanilla python3 (or 2) via miniconda
   * a spectral cube fits viewer (ds9, casaviewer, QFitsView). See also https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_viewer.html

TBD   - see [README_SD2018_data](README_SD2018_data) for more details

Again, we will have a USB and portable HDD during the meeting for copying the large datasets.
