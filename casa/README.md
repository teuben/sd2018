Here we discuss CASA and derived products to do array combinations.

## CASA

CASA: (Common Astronomy Software Applications) is used for all ALMA
and VLA calibration and mapping, and the natural starting point to

## QAC

QAC: (Quick Array Combinations) is a set of functions to help you
call CASA routines to exersize array combination techniques. It will
use a number of other methods (see tp2vis, sd2vis, ssc etc.)

See https://github.com/teuben/QAC how to install.


## TP2VIS

TP2VIS: a new routine to help with a Joint Deconvolution style of
combining single dish (TP) with interferometric data (VIS).

Installation can be done via QAC.


## SD2VIS

SD2VIS: similar to TP2VIS but only works on single pointings, no mosaic.

Installation can be done via QAC.
