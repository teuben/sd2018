Here we discuss CASA and derived products to do array combinations.

CASA: (Common Astronomy Software Applications) is used for all ALMA

TP2VIS: a new routine to help with a Joint Deconvolution style of
combining single dish (TP) with interferometric data (VIS).

QAC: (Quick Array Combinations) is a set of functions to help you
call CASA routines to exersize array combination techniques.
