The QAC benchmark.
==================

On a Linux system, if you have the memory, and your problem is small
enough to fit in memory, here's the fastest way to run the benchmark.
The default QAC bench needs about 3GB in memory to run, and takes
about 3 minutes to run. so most current 2018 should be good for this.

On a Mac I don't know the trick, but would love to hear an update.

Here's sample commands you can cut and paste and/or adapt:

casa-config --version
mkdir /dev/shm/bench
cd /dev/shm/bench
curl http://admit.astro.umd.edu/~teuben/QAC/qac_bench.tar.gz | tar zxf -
cp ~/.casa/QAC/test/bench.py .
time casa --nogui -c bench.py

Send me your fastest results and I'll enter you in the list...

Caution:  the current benchmark seems to drift in time, and can cause
minor deviations from the expected flux (383.6....). I plan to "fix" that.
