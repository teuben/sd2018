In preparation for the Bolometer data reduction tutorials, you may
want to download and install a recent version of Boa, which includes
scripts and calibration files for Artemis. The easiest way is to
download the repository from GitHub:
https://github.com/FredSchuller/BoADAS.git

Note that this has been successfully installed on various flavours of
linux, but this does NOT compile on Mac OS X - although it does work
on a virtual machine running linux on a Mac.

Also note that you dont *need* to have Boa on your personal laptop,
since ESO will provide us with a number of computers where all the
required software has been installed already.
